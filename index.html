            <p>My name is Frank Flores. I got my Associates in Computer Science with an emphasis in programming in 2018. I currently work as a field technician troubleshooting desktops, laptops, servers, switches, routers, etc. as well as work with cabling and cable management. Before that I worked for Trader Joe's for 10+ years and really enjoyed it, but had the chance to work with computer and network hardware/software and took that plunge.</p>
            <p>Just recently I got a offered a position doing tier 2 IT support and am looking forward to working in this type of environment. Apart from always being interested in hardware/software and PC support, I have taken courses in C++, Java, and was teaching myself Python but put that on hold while I take this Full Stack Web Development course. I plan on contuining with the Python lessons after the bootcamp ends to try and tie in Python with web development.</p>
            <p>Besides school and work, I enjoy rock climbing (indoors and outdoors), grew up skateboarding and although I don't skate much anymore (or was every really good), I still watch and get excited when a new skate video comes out. I live in South Pasadena, CA and love going to concerts/shows. Music has and will always be a big part of my life and who I am.</p>
